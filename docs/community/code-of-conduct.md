**Confidentiality:**

All community leaders are obligated to **respect the privacy and security** of the reporter of any incident.

Reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality to protect all parties involved.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Example Violations:**
- Using unprofessional language
- Minor disruptions in discussions
- Unintentional offensive behavior

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Example Violations:**
- Repeated unprofessional behavior after correction
- Pattern of inappropriate comments
- Mild harassment or trolling

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Duration:** Typically 30-90 days, depending on severity

**Example Violations:**
- Sustained harassment
- Deliberate intimidation
- Serious disruption of community discussions
- Repeated violations after warning

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

**Example Violations:**
- Severe harassment or threats
- Pattern of code of conduct violations
- Doxxing or privacy violations
- Hate speech or discrimination

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly accused or penalized:

1. **Email the maintainers** at developer@flamingquaks.dev within 14 days
2. **Explain your perspective** with supporting evidence
3. **Maintainers will review** and respond within 7 business days
4. **Decision is final** after appeal review
