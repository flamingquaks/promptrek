  # Autonomous Agents Example

  This configuration demonstrates autonomous AI agents that can perform
  tasks with varying levels of trust and autonomy.

  ## Trust Levels

  - **full**: Agent can act without approval
  - **partial**: Agent requires approval for sensitive operations
  - **untrusted**: Agent requires approval for all operations
